<p style="font-size:30px; color:black; border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:blue; padding: 1em;">We are at a crossroads in our democracy. Current voting system highly lacks in a technology though there is a lot of ways to make the process easier.Going digital is one of accountability.- citizens are losing their trust in the democratic. system increasingly.Elected candidates must explore the technology to make voting more transparent and easier. Citizen also don’t know what is the process inside the EVM machine like how it is working, whether it is considering the vote as we have casted etc. This is the reason. Why political Parties blaming. the voting machines. Yes, they might be true because the present EVM machines are “BLACK BOX” since we also have no idea what is exactly happening inside a machine.We just believe the result at the end of the process what the machine is giving us.Thus, in this way effective and accurate voting process can be achieved because no one will be left out without getting their right to vote for their desired candidate.  </p>
